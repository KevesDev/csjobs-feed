Our client roster includes Google, Stripe, Figma, Hinge, Black Socialists in America, ACLU, Pratt, Parsons, Mozilla, The Nobel Prize, MIT, Gnosis, Etsy &amp;amp; Gagosian. We’re the software team behind innovative products like The Light Phone &amp;amp; Mill, and a global, decentralized community space collective called Index Space.
We think of our garden3d as collective for creative people, prioritizing a happy, talented, and diverse studio culture. We work on projects that bring value to our world, and we balance deep care for the work we do with a genuine curiosity about life outside of our jobs.
About the client
Our client is an early-stage AI startup based in NYC (but open to remote team members). The founders have experience building and scaling successful ventures including a 9-figure exit.
Who we’re looking for:
We’re looking for a Senior Data Engineer with deep expertise in designing and owning data pipelines, workflow orchestration, and complex data integrations. You’ll play a key role in evolving our data ingestion architecture, from an existing in-house, code-defined workflow system backed by queues, to a more scalable and observable orchestration layer using Prefect.
In this role, you’ll lead the development and optimization of pipelines handling both structured and unstructured data from a wide range of sources, including web crawls and scrapers. You’ll be expected to make architectural decisions, ensure reliability and scalability, and establish best practices for workflow design, monitoring, and performance as our data platform grows.
In this role, you’ll work across a variety of initiatives to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. Responsibilities will include:

Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines, troubleshooting new errors, and addressing format drift
Extracting and enriching additional data elements from diverse sources
Reprocessing and validating large datasets in batch workflows
Designing and integrating new data sources into existing pipelines
Aligning and integrating extracted data with the core application data model to ensure consistency and usability
Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed

Who you are
The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top level / strategic conversations.
We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design &amp;amp; quality — so a variety of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!
Must Have Competencies:

Senior-level Python expertise
Experience with data/workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Prefect, Airflow, Dagster)
A thorough understanding ETL &amp;amp; data transformation for the ingestion of industry standard LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc)
Familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs)
Skilled in interfacing with APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini/Vertex, etc.) using wrapper libraries such as Instructor, LiteLLM, etc.
Practical experience in prompt engineering
Ability to work with structured outputs and potentially tool calling
5+ years general experience in backend (Ruby on Rails, Elixir Phoenix, Python Django, or Node Express) and/or native app development (React Native, Flutter, Android, AOSP, Kotlin/Java).

Nice to Have Competencies:
We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the areas below are relevant to us!

Experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), particularly Cloud Run and Cloud Tasks
Knowledge of search technologies, including embeddings and vector databases for semantic search, as well as keyword-based search (BM25)
Familiarity with PySpark for batch data processing
Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and other generalist AI-enabled application patterns
Client-facing experience: working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions
Product management experience: defining product roadmaps and collaborating closely with stakeholders
Engineering management experience: leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers
Recent experience working in a startup environment
NYC-based preferred for collaboration, but not a strict requirement.

Compensation
The pay scale ranges from $125 p/hr to $175 p/hr | $150-200k/year&amp;nbsp;based on experience.
In addition to cash compensation, equity may be offered for candidates with the right level of experience, commitment, and long-term alignment.
How we interview:
Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.

    URL: https://mobena.co/


Mobena is a three-person, remote-first startup building the “evolution” of multi-generational tax/estate planning software, targeting the advisors of America’s 2 million wealthiest families. We’re currently hiring our first dedicated UI Engineer to “own” the frontend of our flagship product, Mobena Evolution, for which we have little to no frontend code. You’ll work directly with our backend/algorithm-focused CTO, as well as our designer-founder, to turn evolving Figma concepts into fast, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces.
What You’ll Do

Choose and justify the frameworks and tools that best fit our needs.

We have some holdover prototype code in Vite JS, but you can take it or leave it; all of our Figma concepts are new.
The backend is a standard HTTP API. We are open to everything from established web stacks (React, Angular, Svelte, Vite) to cross-platform or native solutions (Qt, WASM, .NET MAUI, Tauri, Electron, Tk)—literally anything, if you can convince us it’s the right choice.

Build our UI from the ground up, establishing clear, maintainable patterns for components, state management, styling, testing, performance, and accessibility.
Collaborate to refine and sometimes re-frame existing screen designs in Figma.
Connect the frontend to our APIs (REST, GraphQL, or similar).
Lay groundwork for future mobile clients; however, experience in this regard is a plus rather than a requirement.

About You

You’ve shipped an interactive application—web, desktop, or mobile—via coursework, open source, side project or professional work.
You care about usability and design quality. (That is, you care about the user.)
You learn by doing: building things rather than sitting in committee.
You are happy to say I don’t know. We try to cultivate “beginner’s mind” at Mobena—it helps us avoid conventional traps and groupthink. The first step of thinking like a beginner is acknowledging your own ignorance! 😊
You can defend your technical choices in clear English, and can take credit for your successes as well your mistakes.
You are comfortable in an early-stage, collaborative environment.
