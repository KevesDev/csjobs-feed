You'll join our cross-functional Growth team as our lead engineer, releasing features, a/b tests, and big bets that improve how new users onboard, discover value, and stay active as Clerk users. In a world where how we code and build is rapidly changing, you'll get the chance to shape how Clerk interacts with AI agents as well, and collaborate with engineers at a company that is at the leading edge of developer and AI tooling.
By collaborating and shipping across our various teams and surfaces (SDK, docs/quickstarts, dashboard onboarding, backend), you’ll help us track and discover learnings as Clerk enters its next phase of growth. One of the best parts? You're building for yourself since our target demographic is developers.

Work with various Clerk engineering teams such as AI enablement, Docs Engineering, Product teams, Marketing, and more to improve developers’ experiences using Clerk.


Help shape how AI agents interact with our MCP, prompts, and APIs. Optimize onboarding for agent-driven workflows. You’ll help define what developer experience looks like in Claude Code, Cursor, etc.


Who you are:


Five+ years hands-on software engineering.


1–2+ years running growth experiments in PLG/SaaS a plus but not required (dev tools experience is ideal).


Full-stack fluency with professional experience in JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js) and Go preferred, plus strong SQL.


Confident with your data. You can define events, query BigQuery, and analyze in PostHog and Hex (or something similar).




User-focused and all about open collaboration. You’re a team player who can lead and is comfortable sharing dashboards, PRs, and read-outs.


You’re not afraid to ask questions and are a clear communicator.


Excited to embrace and leverage LLM-based tools to drive engineering work. You’re constantly iterating on your AI workflows to become a better engineer.

Experience working on SDKs or developer onboarding flows is a plus.

    URL: http://oneilinteractive.com



The goal of search engine optimization is to increase a website’s discoverability. In recent years, the act of consumer discovery occurs across an increasingly diverse collection of interfaces.
The Optimization Specialist at ONeil Interactive is responsible for working in concert with the Optimization Manager – maximizing discoverability for all potential origins: search engines, generative engines, listing engines, and beyond.
Who the Optimization Specialist is:

You are endlessly curious; naturally metabolizing uncertainty into energy. The uncharted nature of SEO does not discourage you. It motivates you.
You aim to be correct, but you are not paralyzed by a fear of being wrong. You dig deeper, relentlessly exploring beyond the surface in pursuit of a more perfect answer.
You do not seek to know things, but to understand the nature of those things — the how and why.
You’re seeking a workplace where big egos are forbidden and high performance is required. Your aim is nothing short of excellence in your field, and you want co-workers that are equally driven. You are eager to learn and eager to teach.
You have a deep understanding of the internet, websites, and technology in general. You know your blindspots, but you also know how to fill those gaps with research. You don’t hesitate to seek the counsel of colleagues.
You communicate with humble confidence. You do not fear questions. You’ve already asked yourself the same questions others are likely to ask. You are not offended when your ideas are respectfully challenged.
You present reports and recommendations with an honest clarity, adapting technical topics to meet your audience’s acumen. Your conclusions are supported by data, but your message centers the story the data tells.
You have a bias toward action. You believe that “done” is better than “perfect.”
You have a black belt in spreadsheet formulas. Data visualization is your happy place.
You’re a vociferous reader and cautious consumer of emerging SEO trends. You know how to identify credible information and filter out the scams. You evolve and adapt as needed.
You don’t wait to be asked. You proactively identify opportunities and needs, then come prepared with well-researched solutions to fill them.
You deliver a consistent degree of dependability and quality. You understand that excellence is a habit, not an act, especially when serving clients.

Example Activities in the Day-to-Day Role

Website audits: Defining, executing, evaluating, and presenting.
Advising clients to ensure they understand the SEO strategies tailored to their specific websites.
Creating Looker Studio reports that visualize comprehensive performance data.
Leading the (virtual) meetings with optimization clients.
Setting performance benchmarks and KPIs for ongoing evaluation.
Identifying, investigating, and resolving technical SEO issues related to indexing, Core Web Vitals, traffic data, event collection, and site performance.
Contributing to content strategy development and creating content to support SEO goals.
Researching and resourcing data from credible sources to develop effective strategies.

Hi there!
Zapier is building the world’s leading AI orchestration platform, where automation and intelligence work hand in hand. As teams and organizations increasingly rely on AI to power their workflows, Zapier is expanding the capabilities, reliability, and adaptability of its platform—so that every automated process can think, act, and evolve alongside the people it supports.
We’re hiring&amp;nbsp;UX Engineers&amp;nbsp;to join several high-impact teams across the company. If you’re passionate about bridging design and engineering, crafting delightful, accessible, and high-fidelity experiences, and ensuring our product feels cohesive, intuitive, and expressive, we’d love to hear from you.
One of these teams is&amp;nbsp;Builder Copilot, where we’re reimagining how people create automation with the help of AI. Copilot is Zapier’s AI-powered building experience—guiding users from high-level intent to fully configured, production-ready systems. The team works at the intersection of generative AI, complex UI, and real-time feedback, designing experiences that seamlessly shift between conversational guidance and direct manipulation of the product. As a UX Engineer on this team, you’d partner closely with design, product, and engineering to prototype new interaction patterns, push on the boundaries of AI-assisted creation, and help define what intuitive, trustworthy AI tooling looks like in a professional workflow builder.
&amp;nbsp;

Build experiences used by millions of users worldwide


Champion design fidelity, accessibility, and motion quality across teams

Collaborate with cross-functional teams across Product, Design, and Support


Work in a high-ownership environment with visible user impact and fast iteration

Demonstrated ability to translate&amp;nbsp;Figma&amp;nbsp;(or similar) design systems into scalable, production-ready component libraries


A keen eye for visual polish, interaction detail, and animation quality


Fluency in accessibility standards (WCAG, ARIA) and inclusive design principles


Familiarity with design tokens, component theming, and responsive layout systems


Experience designing and implementing UI for complex, stateful workflows or builder-style products


Experience documenting patterns, components, and motion guidelines for shared use


A track record of tight collaboration with Product Designers to maintain high design fidelity


Comfort working in ambiguous, fast-evolving problem spaces where&amp;nbsp;patterns are still being defined


Strong interest in the leading edges of AI-assisted product experiences, including conversational and guided workflows


(Very nice to have)&amp;nbsp;Experience shipping AI-powered features in production, including consideration for trust, failure states, and iteration


(Nice to have)&amp;nbsp;Comfort with lightweight backend integration or prototyping tools (e.g., Next.js, Storybook, or Framer)


Curiosity and craft—someone who obsesses over the small details that make big differences


A mindset of continuous improvement—across tools, process, and personal growth

We also use these images in our local development environment allowing coding locally against all of our services. We have a well-documented public API that is consumed by our front-end JavaScript app as well as numerous integrations. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools.
&amp;nbsp;
Our product development process is inspired by Shape Up. We love open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and on The Making of Close, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp;amp; Engineering blog. Check out our open source projects like SocketShark, TaskTiger, LimitLion and ciso8601.

About SuperPlane
SuperPlane is an AI-native DevOps control plane. Our mission is to build the platform teams use to ship and manage software in the AI era.
Agents are helping us write an order of magnitude more code, while systems have become too complex for human-driven ops alone. We're rethinking DevOps from first principles for the AI era: a single control layer where engineers and agents safely collaborate.
We move fast. We aim high. If that sounds like the kind of problem you want to work on, we’d love to talk.
About the Role
At SuperPlane, you’ll build the Cursor for DevOps..
This is an applied role. You’ll take modern AI capabilities such as LLMs, agents, retrieval, planning, and evaluation and turn them into reliable, observable, production systems that real engineers depend on. You’ll work at the boundary between models, infrastructure, and product, making careful tradeoffs between capability, latency, cost, and safety.
What You’ll Do


Design and implement AI-powered features end to end, including prompts, agents, tools, retrieval, evaluation, and feedback loops.


Build agent systems that interact safely with infrastructure, codebases, and deployment pipelines.


Integrate LLMs deeply into product workflows as core platform primitives.


Own quality across correctness, reliability, latency, and cost of AI systems in production.


Collaborate closely with Product, Frontend, and Backend engineers to ship cohesive user-facing features.


Establish best practices for prompt design, evaluation, observability, and iteration.


Requirements


You shipped production systems where LLMs, tool calling, or RAG workflows were part of the core functionality.


You’ve built and owned highly reliable backend systems with strong engineering judgment and technical depth.&amp;nbsp; You are willing to master Go and Typescript.


You’ve developed systematic LLM evaluation pipelines using observability tools (LangSmith/Braintrust) to track performance and regressions.


You worked closely with product and frontend partners to deliver user-facing features.


You communicate clearly in writing and in technical discussions.


Why You’ll Love Working at SuperPlane


Work on an open source platform shaping the future of DevOps worldwide.


Build AI systems that operate real infrastructure, not toy demos.


Competitive compensation &amp;amp; meaningful equity in a high-growth startup.


Fully remote and flexible environment that lets you focus and create.

About Us
DynamiCare Health is a digital therapeutics startup that helps people overcome addiction. In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health.&amp;nbsp;
We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most.
&amp;nbsp;
About the job
Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields.&amp;nbsp;
As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making.
We are currently striving to expand our user base and increase retention rates, with a Series A funding round on the horizon. We use a Ruby on Rails application, which powers multiple subdomains and includes a REST API that supports our member-facing React Native mobile app, as well as an Analytics application utilizing ActionView, React, and Stimulus.
We believe DynamiCare is a great place to work. You'll collaborate in real time to make informed product decisions and play an active role in shaping the company's direction every day. We value your time and mental well-being, and we offer flexibility in working hours and time off. While there may be times when you need to jump in to resolve a critical bug, we strive to stay calm, focus on the root cause, and improve our workflows rather than place blame.
Here are some examples of the work you might be doing at DynamiCare:

Monitoring and responding to mobile and server package vulnerabilities, applying patches promptly, and evaluating whether they pose any risk to our users.
Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency.
Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments.
Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics.
Creating and maintaining new background jobs to improve the scalability and performance of our application.
Ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance with HIPAA.

&amp;nbsp;
About you
We’re seeking a candidate with a passion for technology and a motivation to make the world a better place.
Your primary responsibilities will include full-stack development, DevOps, and maintaining strong data security across our platform. You should have at least three years of experience with our core frameworks: Ruby on Rails and React Native. Experience deploying and managing applications using CircleCI, Aptible, and AWS is especially valuable.
Experience working within the confines of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 is a strong plus, given the sensitive nature of our work. We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team.
Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one. We value thoughtful onboarding and provide you with the time and support needed to learn our systems and processes. Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates.&amp;nbsp;
We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity.
A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters.
While you’ll report to our Director of IT &amp;amp; Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges.
This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time. You’re free to work wherever you succeed the most: whether it be at home or in a coffee shop. We are hiring from anywhere in the United States.
