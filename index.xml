About Us
Close is a bootstrapped, profitable, 100% remote, ~100 person team of thoughtful individuals who prioritize taking ownership and making a meaningful impact. We’re eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again.
&amp;nbsp;
We 💛 small scaling businesses. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or a complex UI. We are out to supercharge sales productivity with the most modern, thoughtfully designed, all-in-one, communication-focused CRM.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Our backend tech stack consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our TaskTiger scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. We have CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to Kubernetes clusters. We also use these images in our local development environment allowing coding locally against all of our services. We have a well-documented public API that is consumed by our front-end JavaScript app as well as numerous integrations. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools.
&amp;nbsp;
Our product development process is inspired by Shape Up. We love open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and on The Making of Close, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp;amp; Engineering blog. Check out our open source projects like SocketShark, TaskTiger, LimitLion and ciso8601.

About SuperPlane
SuperPlane is an AI-native DevOps control plane. Our mission is to build the platform teams use to ship and manage software in the AI era.
Agents are helping us write an order of magnitude more code, while systems have become too complex for human-driven ops alone. We're rethinking DevOps from first principles for the AI era: a single control layer where engineers and agents safely collaborate.
We move fast. We aim high. If that sounds like the kind of problem you want to work on, we’d love to talk.
About the Role
At SuperPlane, you’ll build the Cursor for DevOps..
This is an applied role. You’ll take modern AI capabilities such as LLMs, agents, retrieval, planning, and evaluation and turn them into reliable, observable, production systems that real engineers depend on. You’ll work at the boundary between models, infrastructure, and product, making careful tradeoffs between capability, latency, cost, and safety.
What You’ll Do


Design and implement AI-powered features end to end, including prompts, agents, tools, retrieval, evaluation, and feedback loops.


Build agent systems that interact safely with infrastructure, codebases, and deployment pipelines.


Integrate LLMs deeply into product workflows as core platform primitives.


Own quality across correctness, reliability, latency, and cost of AI systems in production.


Collaborate closely with Product, Frontend, and Backend engineers to ship cohesive user-facing features.


Establish best practices for prompt design, evaluation, observability, and iteration.


Requirements


You shipped production systems where LLMs, tool calling, or RAG workflows were part of the core functionality.


You’ve built and owned highly reliable backend systems with strong engineering judgment and technical depth.&amp;nbsp; You are willing to master Go and Typescript.


You’ve developed systematic LLM evaluation pipelines using observability tools (LangSmith/Braintrust) to track performance and regressions.


You worked closely with product and frontend partners to deliver user-facing features.


You communicate clearly in writing and in technical discussions.


Why You’ll Love Working at SuperPlane


Work on an open source platform shaping the future of DevOps worldwide.


Build AI systems that operate real infrastructure, not toy demos.


Competitive compensation &amp;amp; meaningful equity in a high-growth startup.


Fully remote and flexible environment that lets you focus and create.

About Us
DynamiCare Health is a digital therapeutics startup that helps people overcome addiction. In 8 peer-reviewed publications, DynamiCare increased quit rates for opioids, stimulants, alcohol, and tobacco by 2-4x compared to typical treatment. DynamiCare has won FDA Breakthrough Status and is already breaking into U.S. healthcare system reimbursement with partners that include the State of Rhode Island, Allegheny County of Pennsylvania, BCBS of Massachusetts, Horizon BCBSNJ, Spring Health, and Cityblock Health.&amp;nbsp;
We understand that recovery isn't one-size-fits-all, which is why our platform provides the flexibility and continuous support needed for sustainable behavior change. We're transforming addiction care and helping more people reclaim their lives from substance use disorders. Through the Digital Recovery Platform, DynamiCare is bringing proven therapeutic approaches into the digital age, making recovery support available whenever and wherever our members need it most.
&amp;nbsp;
About the job
Working as a Full-Stack Engineer at DynamiCare, you'll join a fully remote Agile team to design, build, and maintain secure, evidence-based applications. Since we're a small business, you'll have the opportunity to wear many different hats related to DevOps, Security, and other engineering-related fields.&amp;nbsp;
As the primary developer at DynamiCare, you'll have ownership over the codebase, making this a huge opportunity for impact. There will also be room for growth in terms of leadership as the team expands, with potential to shape practices, mentor future developers, and take on greater responsibility in technical decision-making.
We are currently striving to expand our user base and increase retention rates, with a Series A funding round on the horizon. We use a Ruby on Rails application, which powers multiple subdomains and includes a REST API that supports our member-facing React Native mobile app, as well as an Analytics application utilizing ActionView, React, and Stimulus.
We believe DynamiCare is a great place to work. You'll collaborate in real time to make informed product decisions and play an active role in shaping the company's direction every day. We value your time and mental well-being, and we offer flexibility in working hours and time off. While there may be times when you need to jump in to resolve a critical bug, we strive to stay calm, focus on the root cause, and improve our workflows rather than place blame.
Here are some examples of the work you might be doing at DynamiCare:

Monitoring and responding to mobile and server package vulnerabilities, applying patches promptly, and evaluating whether they pose any risk to our users.
Refactor Rails models to enhance feature development and data processing efficiency.
Improve our appointment tracking features to include recurring appointments.
Maintaining a probability engine used to schedule substance tests, ensuring functionality by writing a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
Building new serializers in Rails to help export data in XLSX or CSV format so that our team has insights on key metrics.
Creating and maintaining new background jobs to improve the scalability and performance of our application.
Ensuring data security, privacy, and compliance with HIPAA.

&amp;nbsp;
About you
We’re seeking a candidate with a passion for technology and a motivation to make the world a better place.
Your primary responsibilities will include full-stack development, DevOps, and maintaining strong data security across our platform. You should have at least three years of experience with our core frameworks: Ruby on Rails and React Native. Experience deploying and managing applications using CircleCI, Aptible, and AWS is especially valuable.
Experience working within the confines of HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 is a strong plus, given the sensitive nature of our work. We’re also looking for someone familiar with Agile development, particularly Scrum and sprint-based workflows. Proficiency with collaboration and project management tools like Asana, Confluence, and Jira is important for staying aligned with the team.
Even though you’re experienced, we don’t expect you to hit the ground running on day one. We value thoughtful onboarding and provide you with the time and support needed to learn our systems and processes. Strong communication is essential here, whether you're debugging code, collaborating with designers, or explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates.&amp;nbsp;
We also foster a collaborative environment where every voice is heard, and respectful dialogue and constructive feedback are encouraged. Our shared goal is to build a product that helps people recover from addiction, and we believe that happens best when everyone works together with openness and clarity.
A Computer Science degree or equivalent is not required for this position. If you have the chops and the skills needed to do the job well, that’s all that matters.
While you’ll report to our Director of IT &amp;amp; Engineering, we strongly believe in autonomy here at DynamiCare. It’s vital that you know how to manage your time, and we trust that you will as well. Investing the time and effort here will help advance your career and expose you to new and exciting challenges.
This position is remote and operates on Eastern Time. You’re free to work wherever you succeed the most: whether it be at home or in a coffee shop. We are hiring from anywhere in the United States.

Monitoring and maintaining data pipelines, troubleshooting new errors, and addressing format drift
Extracting and enriching additional data elements from diverse sources
Reprocessing and validating large datasets in batch workflows
Designing and integrating new data sources into existing pipelines
Aligning and integrating extracted data with the core application data model to ensure consistency and usability
Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices
Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline
Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed

Who you are
The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top level / strategic conversations.
We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design &amp;amp; quality — so a variety of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!
Must Have Competencies:

Senior-level Python expertise
Experience with data/workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Prefect, Airflow, Dagster)
A thorough understanding ETL &amp;amp; data transformation for the ingestion of industry standard LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc)
Familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs)
Skilled in interfacing with APIs (OpenAI, Google Gemini/Vertex, etc.) using wrapper libraries such as Instructor, LiteLLM, etc.
Practical experience in prompt engineering
Ability to work with structured outputs and potentially tool calling
5+ years general experience in backend (Ruby on Rails, Elixir Phoenix, Python Django, or Node Express) and/or native app development (React Native, Flutter, Android, AOSP, Kotlin/Java).

Nice to Have Competencies:
We’re always pitching for new and exciting technology niches. Some of the areas below are relevant to us!

Experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), particularly Cloud Run and Cloud Tasks
Knowledge of search technologies, including embeddings and vector databases for semantic search, as well as keyword-based search (BM25)
Familiarity with PySpark for batch data processing
Experience working with LLMs, Vector Databases, and other generalist AI-enabled application patterns
Client-facing experience: working directly with customers to gather requirements and provide technical solutions
Product management experience: defining product roadmaps and collaborating closely with stakeholders
Engineering management experience: leading teams, setting technical direction, and mentoring developers
Recent experience working in a startup environment
NYC-based preferred for collaboration, but not a strict requirement.

Compensation
The pay scale ranges from $125 p/hr to $175 p/hr | $150-200k/year&amp;nbsp;based on experience.
In addition to cash compensation, equity may be offered for candidates with the right level of experience, commitment, and long-term alignment.
How we interview:
Our interview process starts with a call where you get to meet a few members of our team. From there we’ll ask appropriate candidates to take part in a technical exercise which helps illustrate skill level and comfort.
