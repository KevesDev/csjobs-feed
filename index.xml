Ready to be a Titan?ServiceTitan is looking for an innovative Manager of Web Development who leads by example to join our Web Team. This hybrid player/coach role reports into the Director of Web Marketing and is designed for a leader who wants to stay technically grounded without being "in the weeds" 100% of the time.You will split your focus between hands-on technical contribution (working tickets, architectural design, code reviews) and formal people management (1:1s, career development, and team health for both Dev and QA) while leading the end-to-end development and optimization of our four flagship marketing websites: www.servicetitan.com, www.youraspire.com, www.convex.com, and www.fieldroutes.com.Our websites are critical to the user journey and serve as the engine for our overall pipeline generation program. We are seeking a strategic thinker who understands the unique nuances of high-performance marketing websites compared to SaaS products. If you are a proactive problem-solver who excels in a rapid-growth environment, this is the place for you.What You'll Do:Technical Contribution&amp;nbsp;Strategic Coding: Rather than high-volume daily tasks, you will focus on high-impact tickets, complex bug fixes, or foundational architectural work.Code Quality &amp;amp; Reviews: Act as the final line of defense for code quality. You will perform critical PR reviews and ensure that QA and Dev are tightly integrated.Technical Unblocking: Identify technical debt or workflow bottlenecks that slow the team down and get hands-on to resolve them.Innovation &amp;amp; Support: Proactively identify and champion the adoption of new technologies (including AI integration) while providing ongoing support for existing features and security patches.Project Leadership: Operate as a Technical Lead, successfully launching and completing multiple large-scale technical projects simultaneously while impacting the immediate team's success.Vendor Management: Take the lead on working with third-party vendors for various integrations, ensuring seamless connectivity across our marketing stack.&amp;nbsp;Technical Architecture: Lead the technical design and implementation of significant features that span multiple components, ensuring code quality, scalability, and adherence to best practices.Process Improvement: Develop and implement technical process improvements, such as advanced CI/CD strategies and new coding standards, to be adopted across the team.People &amp;amp; Team Leadership&amp;nbsp;Lead and Manage: Serve as the direct people manager for our team of Web Developers and QA Engineers, fostering a culture of technical excellence and continuous growth.Growth &amp;amp; Performance: Conduct regular 1:1s focused on both tactical output and long-term career progression. You will own performance reviews and compensation conversations.Team Dynamics: Actively manage interpersonal relationships and team culture. You are responsible for building a cohesive, high-trust environment across the Dev and QA disciplines.Resource Planning: Work with the Director of Web Marketing to balance team capacity with roadmap ambitions, ensuring the team is challenged but not burned out.What You’ll Bring:Balanced Perspective: You understand that "winning" means the team is shipping great software, not just that you personally finished a ticket.Technical Empathy: Because you still push code, you have a realistic pulse on the codebase, which informs how you manage deadlines and individual performance.Mentorship Mindset: You enjoy the challenge of coaching a QA engineer on automation strategy just as much as helping a developer optimize a database query.Management &amp;amp; Soft Skills: Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a proven ability to manage direct reports and influence cross-functional stakeholders.Problem Solving: Strong ability to troubleshoot complex, cross-service technical challenges and identify root causes rather than surface-level issues.Architecture Knowledge: Advanced understanding of system architecture, distributed systems, and performance optimization for highly available applications.Modern Stack Experience: High level of confidence with static site generators (Gatsby JS, Next JS), Node JS, and headless CMS platforms like Contentful.Technical Expertise: Deep proficiency in front-end technologies (HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, JavaScript) and frameworks like React JS and TailwindCSS.Standards &amp;amp; Compliance: Solid knowledge of WCAG accessibility standards, SEO best practices, and secure coding principles.Tools of the Trade: Proven experience with TDD, Gitflow, automated E2E testing, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP).QA &amp;amp; Automation Experience: Familiarity with QA automation tools and processes strongly preferred.Educational Background: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Web Development, or a related field (or equivalent work experience).Be Human With Us:Being human isn’t about checking every box on a list. It’s about the experiences we have, people we meet, and the perspectives we share. So, if you have the skills but are hesitant to apply because of your background, apply anyway. We need amazing people like you to help us challenge the conventional and think differently about the problems that we’re solving. We’re in this together. Come be human, with us.&amp;nbsp;What We Offer:When you join our team, you’re not just accepting a job. You’re making a career move. Here’s how we’ll support you in doing some of the most impactful work of your career:Flextime, recognition, and support for autonomous work: Flexible time off with ample learning and development opportunities to continue growing your career. We offer a comprehensive onboarding program, leadership training for Titans at all levels, and other programs and events. Great work is rewarded through Bonusly, peer-nominated awards, and more.Holistic health and wellness benefits: Company-paid medical, dental, and vision (with 100% employer paid options and 90% coverage for dependents), FSA and HSA, 401k match, and telehealth options including memberships to One Medical.Support for Titans at all stages of life: Parental leave and support, up to $20k in fertility services (i.e. IUI and IVF), surrogacy, and adoption reimbursement, on demand maternity support through Maven Maternity, free breast milk shipping through Maven Milk, pet insurance, legal advisory services, financial planning tools, and more.At ServiceTitan, we celebrate individuality and uniqueness.

    URL: http://gowalter.co




Senior Software Engineers at Stamped are hands-on builders responsible for designing, developing, and delivering high-quality software that powers our products. This role combines technical depth with product intuition — engineers are expected to think like product partners, not just implementers.
They work closely with Product and the Director of Engineering to rapidly prototype, validate, and scale solutions that drive measurable user value. Senior Engineers bring curiosity, empathy, and a bias for action, leveraging AI tools and modern practices to deliver with speed, reliability, and craftsmanship.
This role has a strong emphasis on user-facing development — building intuitive, performant interfaces and components that merchants interact with daily. While full-stack capability is valued, you'll spend significant time on front-end architecture, UI implementation, and ensuring excellent user experiences across our product suite.
Our current systems include a large .NET/C# foundation on the backend, so familiarity with these technologies is helpful for full-stack collaboration, but your primary focus will be o modern front-end development and the user experience layer.
This group sits at the center of Stamped's shift toward an AI-native, iterative engineering culture — emphasizing autonomy, accountability, and shared ownership across the team.
Responsibilities

Product Engineering:&amp;nbsp;Design, build, test, and ship user-facing features with a focus on polish, performance, and usability.
Front-End Development:&amp;nbsp;Build and maintain responsive, accessible UI components and interfaces using modern frameworks and tooling.
Prototyping &amp;amp; Validation:&amp;nbsp;Rapidly prototype new user experiences to validate value before scaling.
AI-Enabled Development:&amp;nbsp;Use AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, or similar) to accelerate development, reduce repetitive work, and improve code quality.
Technical Judgment: Participate in front-end architecture decisions, component design patterns, and client-side performance optimization. Contribute to discussions on full-stack integration and API design.
Execution &amp;amp; Ownership:&amp;nbsp;Deliver against roadmap commitments with a focus on quality, maintainability, and iteration — especially on user-facing surfaces.
Collaboration:&amp;nbsp;Partner closely with Product and the Director of Engineering to align technical work with customer and business needs. Work alongside designers to ensure high-fidelity implementation of user experiences.
Knowledge Sharing:&amp;nbsp;Document, mentor, and contribute to a culture of learning and openness.
Continuous Improvement:&amp;nbsp;Stay curious and experimental with new tools, frameworks, and AI workflows that can improve speed, quality, or developer experience.




Requirements


5+ years of professional software engineering experience, with significant time spent on front-end or full-stack development
Strong proficiency with modern JavaScript/TypeScript and front-end framework (React, Vue, or similar) — experience building scalable, maintainable component architectures
Experience with responsive design, accessibility standards, and client-side performance optimization
Familiarity with backend technologies and APIs — experience with C#/.NET, Node.js, Python, or similar is a plus for full-stack collaboration
Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS preferred)
Demonstrated use of AI tools or automation in the development workflow
Product mindset: comfort with ambiguity, iteration, and user-centric decision-making
Excellent communication and collaboration skills; thrive in cross-functional teams
