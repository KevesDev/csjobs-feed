About SuperPlane
SuperPlane is an AI-native DevOps control plane. Our mission is to build the platform teams use to ship and manage software in the AI era.
Agents are helping us write an order of magnitude more code, while systems have become too complex for human-driven ops alone. We're rethinking DevOps from first principles for the AI era: a single control layer where engineers and agents safely collaborate.
We move fast. We aim high. If that sounds like the kind of problem you want to work on, we’d love to talk.
About the Role
At SuperPlane, you’ll shape the future of DevOps, creating features that bring intelligence, automation, and simplicity to complex infrastructure workflows.
You'll build interfaces that load instantly, feel flawless, and scale effortlessly. Every tooling choice, every pattern, every optimization decision is yours to make, and you'll be held accountable for the results.
What You’ll Do


Own frontend features from conception to deployment: UI, state management, performance, polish.


Build responsive, performant interfaces that integrate seamlessly with backend APIs and services.


Collaborate with AI and Product teams to implement intelligent, user-facing automation features.


Review peers' work and set the standard for frontend engineering excellence.


Requirements


Expert-level React and modern frontend (TypeScript, performance optimization, build systems, testing)


Full-stack capable: you write backend code when needed without waiting on others. We expect you to learn Go when you join the team.


You are proficient with AI-assisted development (e.g., Claude Code)


You've built production systems that scale and stay fast




You push systems and yourself to world-class standards.


Communicate clearly and collaborate well across teams.
